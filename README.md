**Heart rate variability statistical analysis**

Heart rate is a commonly measured physiological paramter in real timer. [Heart rate variability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate_variability) is where the amount of time between your heartbeats fluctuates slightly. Even though these fluctuations are undetectable except wth specialized devices, they can still indicate current or future health problems, including heart conditions and mental health issues like anxiety and depression[^1]. In this project we will build an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) based electrocardiogram ([ECG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography)) acquisition and analysis system, to measure heart rate variability over long time periods.
